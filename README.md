# The Beer Life
This project was created to be used as a social networking website that can find local breweries near your location. 
The website can dynamicly create detailed information about breweries that are near you utilizing Yelp API and Google Maps. The information is displayed in nice cards that can be updated until no more breweries can be found in your area. Detailed information can be found by clicking a card and details are displayed in a nice modal.

We are in still the process of developing this. 

[Here's a demo of some of the functionality.](http://thebeernetwork.github.io/thebeerlife/)
